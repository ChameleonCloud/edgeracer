# Overview

This repo provides containers, configuration, build scripts, and examples to run
"Doneycar-like" workflows on a variety of targets.

The usual workflow consists of:
1. Drive a small RC car around remotely, while recording camera input and steering commands.
2. Use the data from step 1 to train a small deep learning model
3. Use the ML model to drive the car autonomously



build containers by running `docker buildx bake`
