# Overview

This repo provides containers, configuration, build scripts, and examples to run
"Doneycar-like" workflows on a variety of targets.


To clone this repo, please run:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ChameleonCloud/donkeycar.git
```

If you have already cloned the repo, you can update the submodules by running:

```
git submodule sync
git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
```



The usual workflow consists of:
1. Drive a small RC car around remotely, while recording camera input and steering commands.
2. Use the data from step 1 to train a small deep learning model
3. Use the ML model to drive the car autonomously



build containers by running `docker buildx bake`
